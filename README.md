This repository consists of medically relevant predictive models.

We tackle multiple medical conditions separately in the hopes to ultimately develop an AI capable of making robust diagnoses.

So far we have implemented models for:
 - Alzheimers Disease (https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers)
 - Breast Cancer (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

Conditions to research and implement:
 - Cardiovascular Disease
 - Parkinsons Disease
 - Lung, Blood Cancers
 - n-COVID 19

This repository is in no way completed. The goal is to implement models to be able to predict a plethora of diseases and conditions given specific information.
